**User:** Please read the ai_ground_rules doc and then read the project outline. I have an AWS account I can use. I have a domain I want to use (www.eliiskeans.com). Let's start by creating a development plan. Let's break it down into logical chunks and save this as a new document we can reference and continue to work off of.

**AI (🍀):** Read both documents. Created `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` with 7 phases (Phase 0–6) covering: AWS bootstrap & domain setup, UI skeleton, data ingest, incident formation, WebSocket live push, replay mode, and polish. The plan follows the milestones from the project outline (M0–M4) with a Phase 0 for infrastructure foundation and a Phase 6 for polish. Includes a decision log and open questions about DNS registrar, IaC tool preference (SAM vs CDK), map styling, and CI/CD tooling. Branched off main to `dev-plan` per ground rules.
